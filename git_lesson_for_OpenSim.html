# A lesson on Git for the OpenSim project

---

# Agenda

1. Why are we switching from SVN/SimTK to Git/GitHub?
2. How is Git different from SVN?
3. Install git on your computer.
4. Tutorial A: **using** the Simbody Git repository.
    a. TortoiseGit
    b. command-line git
5. Tutorial B: **contributing** to a repository.
    a. TortoiseGit
    b. command-line git
6. Managing you're own project.
7. Review of key concepts.

NOT covering: how to be the maintainer of a git project.

# Why are we switching from SVN/SimTK to Git/GitHub?

1. **SVN** and **SimTK**:

    a. simple (central repository, fewer commands, simpler concepts).

    b. discourages code review.

    c. branching has high inertia, discourages experimenting.

    d. difficult for outsiders to contribute to the project (open source?).

2. **Git**:

    a. easy to branch code (encourages parallel development, experimenting).

    b. allows use of GitHub.

    c. complicated.

    d. same number of letters as 'SVN'.

3. **GitHub**:

    a. easy to take someone's code and modify it for your own purposes (fork).

    b. friction-less way to tell developers about bugs (issues).

    c. easy to contribute to projects to which you're not a member (pull request).

    d. job opportunitites (employers ask for your GitHub username).

# SVN branches vs git branches

**SVN**

* Branches are copies of the code in a different part of the repository.
* Branches often linger and are not deleted, even after they are no longer used.
* Branches are made infrequently. Majority of coding happens in master.
* Our usage of branches:
    1. Create release branch, develop in parallel with Trunk (unstable)
    2. When release is done, merge part of release branch back into Trunk.

**GIT**

* Branches are just labels to commits (git's revision).
* Commits represent a state (snapshot) of the entire repository.
* Branches are meant to be deleted.
* Make lots of branches. All work is done in outside of the master branch (for
    projects of our scale).
    * Feature branches: "new-component-interface"
    * Bugfix branches: "issue-37"
* Usage:
    1. To implement a feature, make feature branch.
    2. When done with feature, merge back into master ("Trunk").
    3. master is always stable; unstable code is in feature branches.

# Install git

1. Install msysGit (git for windows)
    1. Use Git Bash only (cannot access git from regular Command Window).
    2. Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings.
2. Install TortoiseGit.
3. Configure GIT on your computer.
    1. `git config --global user.name "Christopher Dembia"`
    2. `git config --global user.email "cld72@cornell.edu"`
    3. SSH...not now.
4. Create an account on GitHub.
5. Get added to opensim-org.
6. Explore the opensim-org page.

# Consuming code on GitHub: Simbody

1. Clone the simbody/simbody repository to your computer.
2. Explore with TortoiseGit: clone, log, remotes, branches, tags, checkout, revision graph.
3. Explore with command-line git:
    ```
    git clone https;//github.com/simbody/simbody.git
    git remote -v # -v for verbose
    git branch
    git tag
    git status
    git log
    git checkout Simbody-3.4.1 # this is a tag.
    ```

---

# Git is a distributed VCS: remotes

# Contributing: dummy-opensim-core (slide 1)

1. GitHub fork.
2. Clone your fork.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/myname/dummy-opensim-core.git 
    ```
3. Add the upstream repository as a remote on your computer.
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/opensim-org/dummy-opensim-core.git
    ```
4. Create a new branch.
    ```
    git checkout -b myfeature 
    ```
5. Make some changes.
    1. Create a new file.
    2. Add the new file.
    ```
    git add mynewfile.txt
    ```
    3. Mess around!
    4. What's the state of the working copy?
    ```
    git status
    ```

6. Commit changes.
    ```
    git commit -am"My message." # -a to commit all tracked changes.
    git commit -m"my message."
    git commit
    ```

---

# Contributing: dummy-opensim-core (slide 2)

1. Push your changes to your fork.
    ```
    git push origin myfeature
    ```
2. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
3. Wait for your PR to be accepted.
3. Update your local repository and delete your feature branch.
    ```
    git checkout master 
    git pull upstream master
    git branch -d myfeature # delete LOCAL feature branch
    ```

---

# Contributing: dummy-opensim-core (slide 3)

1. Deal with upstream changes (that occured while you worked on feature).

    a.  Repeat previous two slides.
    ```
    git checkout -b feature2
    (mess around)
    git commit -am"Destroyed OpenSim."
    git push origin feature2
    (submit pull request)
    ```

    b.  Rebase.
    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull upstream master
    git checkout myfeature
    git rebase master
    git push origin :feature2 (deletes branch on GitHub)
    git push origin feature2
    (pull request can now be accepted)
    ```

# Developing on a project for which you're a member (also: personal projects).

* Don't use a fork.
* For SMALL changes, commmit directly to master.
* Submit pull requests WITHIN the same user/organization (on GitHub).

---

# Review of git/GitHub terms and commands

## Terms
* HEAD
* master
* origin
* upstream

## Commands (what's the equivalent in SVN?)
* git clone
* git status
* git commit
* git add
* git checkout
* git merge
* git rebase
* git reset
* git branch
* git tag
* git remote [add]
* git cherry-pick
* git rm [--cached]
* git init
* git fork

---

# Culture

1. Don't work directly on the master branch.
2. Commit often, and atomically (code should compile at each commit).
3. Commit messages

    b. First line should be brief; 50 characters.

    c. Skip a line before your detailed description.

# Online resources to learn about git

* The git book. Really well-written. If you want to understand what's going on, look here. http://git-scm.com/book
* Interactive way to learn the basics of command-line git. https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
* Pretty thorough description of different git commands. http://gitref.org/

Sherm's links:
* Nice overview of git internals: http://nfarina.com/post/9868516270/git-is-simpler
* Git for computer scientists: http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/
* Git crash course: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics
* What is a branch: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is
* Branching workflow discussions:
   * Basics: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows
   * Chris D recommends this: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
   * Different workflows: https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows 
* GitHub's teaching resources: http://teach.github.com/

List of git cheat sheets:
* https://na1.salesforce.com/help/pdfs/en/salesforce_git_developer_cheatsheet.pdf the one I'd use. describes a common workflow.
* http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html very interactive. shows workspace, index, local repo, remote repo.
* https://help.github.com/articles/git-cheatsheet an annotated list of commands
* http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/ very pretty; includes rebase
* https://www.atlassian.com/dms/wac/images/landing/git/atlassian_git_cheatsheet.pdf organized by commands
* http://web.archive.org/web/20090419122050/swxruby.org/git-cheat-sheet.pdf tries to describe sequences of commands, and describes some more advanced commands. not very pretty
